# Opencore EFI folders 
EFI folders for my Desktop and PC.

## Credits
Lots of smart and kind people from Hackintosh community on osxlatitude, dartonia, r/hackintosh and those generous people who wrote all the kexts, pre-compiled all the ACPI patches, hackintosh tools.

Particularly:
1. [Jake Lo](https://osxlatitude.com/profile/1549-jake-lo) from osxlatitude for his invaluable guidance and hardwork whose fruits he shares with us.
2. [Dartonia](https://dortania.github.io/) for his guidance and hardwork.
3. [Lovely-Xpp](https://github.com/Lovely-XPP) - I am basing my EFI on his [work](https://github.com/Lovely-XPP/Dell-Latitude-E7480-Hackintosh). Excellent guy who solved my issues with multi-finger navigation and proper support for all accessories.
3. [Bombich](https://bombich.com) whose "Carbon Copy Cloner" is the first and only paid application that has impressed me the most in the mac world. This tool has saved me several hours of painful rework and enabled me to clone my installation to internal drive of another machine while ensuring that it is bootable and all this with 3 minutes!!. Please buy this tool (Carbon Copy Cloner) as mark of support even if it offers 30 days free trial with all the functionalities.
4. [Merin Systems, Coimbatore](https://t.me/merinsystems) for the exceptional Dell 7480 he sold me for a reasonable price :)
